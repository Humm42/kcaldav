principals.
Its arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Create a new principal with an initial collection
.Qq calendar .
The e-mail address is the principal's name at the current host (see
.Xr hostname 1 )
or
.Qq localhost
if there's no system-wide hostname set.
.It Fl n

with
.Fl e ) .
Ignored if used with
.Fl C .
.It Fl d Ar collection
Add a collection for the principal, doing nothing if the collection
already exists.
If used with
.Fl C ,

.It Fl f Ar caldir
The database directory.
.It Fl u Ar principal

.It Ar resource...
A list of resources to add to the collection of
.Fl d

.Qq calendar
by default.
The name of each resource is set from its filename component.
.El
.Pp
By default, the password is changed for the principal matching the
logged-in user (see
.Xr logname 1 ) .
The database
.Pa kcaldav.db
is looked for in
.Pa @CALPREFIX@ .
.Pp
If the database is created with
.Fl C ,
its owner is set to the current real user.
If the database exists and
.Fl C
or
.Fl u
is used, the current real user (via
.Xr getuid 2 )
must match the database owner or be root.
.Pp
The database must be read-writable by the web server.

.\" Not used in OpenBSD.
.\" .Sh RETURN VALUES
.\" For sections 2, 3, and 9 function return values only.
.\" .Sh ENVIRONMENT
.\" For sections 1, 6, 7, and 8 only.

.Sh EXAMPLES
In the simplest case, root creates and maintains the database.
Assuming the database is in
.Pa @CALPREFIX@ :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# kcaldav.passwd -Cu kristaps
New password: *********
Repeat new password: *********
.Ed
.Pp
After this time, the user
.Qq kristaps
can access their default calendar
.Qq calendar .
.Pp
To have the database modifiable by local users, use a dummy
.Qq kcaldav
user owning the file and creating new users.
Thi assumes that the database doesn't already exist.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# chown _kcaldav @PREFIX@/bin/kcaldav.passwd
# chmod u+s @PREFIX@/bin/kcaldav.passwd
# doas -u _kcaldav kcaldav.passwd -Cu kristaps
New password: *********
Repeat new password: *********
.Ed
.Pp
The user may then set their password:
.Pp
.Dl % kcaldav.passwd -ne kristaps@bsd.lv
.Pp
Or add calendars:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% kcaldav.passwd -nd newcalendar
% kcaldav.passwd -nd secondcalendar
.Ed
.Pp
To add resources to a new or existing calendar:
.Pp
.Dl % kcaldav.passwd -nd newcalendar file1.ics file2.ics
