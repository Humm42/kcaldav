.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kcaldav
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
CGI program minimally implements CalDAV, with an emphasis on security
and simplicity.
To use
.Nm ,
you'll need to first install a calendar database in the compile-time
root directory
.Pa @CALDIR@
with
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 1 .
This root directory is relative to the CGI program's file-system root,
which is often
.Pa /var/www
or similar.
.Pp
Once the database has been installed, clients may access individual
calendars or the calendar root, depending on client functionality.
.Pp
For example, consider the CGI program installed into
.Pa /var/www/cgi-bin/kcaldav
with the CGI's file-system root at
.Pa /var/www ,
reachable via the web server's configuration at
.Pp
.Dl https://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav
.Pp
The calendar root
.Pa @CALDIR@ ,
which thus resolves to
.Pa /var/www@CALDIR@ ,
contains
.Pa kcaldav.db
created by
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 1
specifying a single principal
.Pa kristaps
with a single calendar collection
.Pa calendar
as created with
.Pp
.Dl # kcaldav.passwd -C -u kristaps
.Pp
Most CalDAV clients will ask for the CGI program name, principal name,
and password.
The program name in this example is as follows:
.Pp
.Dl https://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav
.Pp
This is further simplified if the web server is configured to handle a
.Qq well-known
service that redirects to the CGI program name, leaving the only
configuration to be the web server root:
.Pp
.Dl https://localhost
.Pp
For some older clients, the CGI program name will need to include the
principal's name as well as the program name:
.Pp
.Dl https://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav/kristaps/
.Pp
Lastly, there are some clients (possibly only Mozilla Lightning) that
must connect directly to an individual calendar, such as with:
.Pp
.Dl https://localhost/cgi-bin/kcaldav/kristaps/calendar/
.Ss Well-Known Service
Many modern calendar clients use
.Qq well-known
URI identifiers to query a host for its CalDAV.
To enable the
.Qq well-known
service for
.Nm ,
the web server's absolute path
.Pa /.well-known/caldav
must return a 301 redirect to the absolute URL
.Pa https://localhost@CGIURI@ ,
assuming
.Pa localhost
as the CalDAV host such as in the example.
.Ss System-Wide Calendar Administration
Let the root directory be
.Pa /caldav ,
a directory within the CGI script's
.Xr chroot 2
file-system,
which is read-writable by the CGI script running as user www.
Let the dummy user kcaldav be the owner of kcaldav files.
First make
.Xr kcaldav.passwd 1
set-user-ID for modifying the file.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# chown kcaldav @PREFIX@/bin/kcaldav.passwd
# chmod u+s @PREFIX@/bin/kcaldav.passwd
.Ed
.Pp
Create user principals as follows:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# kcaldav.passwd -f /caldav -C -u user1
# kcaldav.passwd -f /caldav -C -u user2
# ...
.Ed
.Pp
Now any local user can modify her principal's password without
administrator intervention.
.Pp
.Dl user1% kcaldav.passwd -f /caldav
.Ss Local Calendar Administration
Let the root directory be
.Pa /home/foo/caldav ,
which is readable by the web server running as user www and
read-writable by the logged-in user
.Qq foo .
First, create the database and add principals as necessary.
.Pp
.Dl % kcaldav.passwd -C -u foo -f /home/foo/caldav
.\" .Sh CONTEXT
.\" For section 9 functions only.
.Ss Web Calendar Administration
.Nm
has built-in support for web-based administration by logged-in
(using HTTP authentication) principals through a web application of
HTML5, JavaScript, and CSS pages using
.Nm
as a JSON backend.
.Pp
Assuming these page have been installed into
.Pa /var/www/htdocs/kcaldav ,
principals can then access the server root,
.Pp
.Dl https://localhost/kcaldav/home.html
.Pp
to see their configuration.
.Pp
The principal
.Qq foo
can modify collection information online.
.Em Note :
the calendar database must be read-writable by the web server.
In general, the directory containing the database will also need to be
writable by the web server for creating its temporary transaction files.
.Sh HTTP METHODS
This section describes each supported HTTP method.
.Ss DELETE
The DELETE method is handled according to RFC 4918.
Principals must have
.Dv DELETE
access.
Resource deletions process the
.Dq If-Match
header, if applied, for conditional deletion.
.Pp
Collection deletions begin by removing the
.Pa kcaldav.conf
file, which renders the directory opaque to
.Nm .
Following that, all files are removed followed by the directory itself.
.Em Note :
it is possible to remove the principal's home URL!
.Ss GET
The GET method is supported for calendar resources (defined by
content-type) as defined by RFC 4918.
The
.Dq If-None-Match
header is processed and checks the file etag (MD5 sum).
In all cases, the principal must have been delegated read access.
.Pp
For the JSON content-type (i.e., web application resources),
.Nm
routes into a management framework.
Only the
.Pa index.html
resource in the server root directory is supported.
Requests for the empty root
.Pq Dq \e
are aliased to
.Pa index.html .
.Ss POST
The POST method is supported only for text/html requests for specific
management (JSON content-type) resources.
POST methods on calendar collections are interpreted by the management
framework as JSON form requests to change collection properties.
The principal must have been delegated write access.
.Ss PROPFIND
The PROPFIND method queries collection or resource properties.
The principal must have been delegated read access.
It accepts the
.Dq Depth
header for recursive reports.
The following is a table of get-able properties.

.Sh IMPLEMENTATION NOTES
The
.Nm
system is fairly complicated, though as simple as it can be.
It focusses on safety and security throughout.
In this section, I describe several important topics regarding
implementation.
.Ss Authentication
.Nm
requires HTTP
.Dq QOP
digest authentication.
A nonce database
.Pa kcaldav.nonce.db
is maintained in the root calendar directory, consisting of nonce values
and their current nonce counts.
The
.Pa kcaldav.nonce.db
file is bound in size, with requests for new nonces evicting the oldest
request.
The use of nonces and nonce counts guarantees that principals are not
subject to replay attacks.
Nonces are 16-bytes of random data from
.Xr arc4random_buf 3 .
.Pp
To protect against attackers starving the nonce database by endlessly
requesting nonces (evicting valid nonces),
.Nm
uses a series of checks.
.Pp
When a client first accesses the system (without authentication), it is
given a random, unrecorded nonce.
.Pp
When the client re-authenticates using the random nonce and principal
credentials, the system first checks that the user is valid.
The nonce is then checked in the database.
If it is not found (the case for principals re-authenticating with the
random nonce), authentication is requested again with the
.Dq stale
directive and a new nonce entry in the database.
Replay nonces request a full re-authentication.
This step ensures that the principal is valid, though it could be a
replay attack from a nonce entry since evicted.
.Pp
Finally, the client re-authenticates with the recorded nonce and is able
to access the system.
.Pp
The remaining attack is for an adversary to build up a database of known
historical responses and replay them all at once.
.Ss Date and Time
Well-defined calendar date and time is required for computing ranges of
free-busy, multiget filters, and so on.
.Nm
parses valid RFC 2445 (iCalendar) calendar dates fully, encompassing
arbitrary repeat-rules and so on.
Parsing UTC time-stamps is well-defined using the formula from the
.Dq Single Unix Specification
section 15 on
.Dq Seconds since epoch .
Parsing embedded time-zone time-stamps is far more complicated, but
fully supported as defined by RFC 2445 using both the SUS algorithm and
Zeller's congruence to compute time components.
Other CalDAV implementations make use of
.Xr tzfile 5
databases: since
.Nm
assumes it is in a
.Xr chroot 2
and that this database is unavailable, it parses all time-zone
definitions directly.
.Pp
One of the most complex components of RFC 2445 is the repeat-rule, such
as that used for time-zone daylight and standard sub-component
definitions.
.Nm
enumerates over all possible repeat-rule instances, and is thus able to
accomodate for arbitrarily-complicated repeat rules.
