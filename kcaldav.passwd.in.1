.El
.Pp
By default, the password is changed for the principal matching the
currently logged-in user from
.Xr getlogin 2 .
The database is looked for in
.Pa @CALPREFIX@ .
If the database exists, the current real user (via
.Xr getuid 2 )
must match the database owner or be root.
If the database is created, its owner is set to the current real user.
.Pp
The database must be read-writable by the web server.

.Sh EXAMPLES
In the simplest case, root creates and maintains the database.
Assuming the database is configured in
.Pa @CALPREFIX@ :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# mkdir @CALPREFIX@
# chown www @CALPREFIX@
# kcaldav.passwd -C -u kristaps
New password: *********
Repeat new password: *********
.Ed
.Pp
After this time, the user
.Qq kristaps
can access their default calendar
.Qq calendar .
.Pp
To have the database modifiable by local users, use a dummy
.Qq kcaldav
user owning the file and creating new users.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# chown _kcaldav @PREFIX@/bin/kcaldav.passwd
# chmod u+s @PREFIX@/bin/kcaldav.passwd
# doas -u _kcaldav kcaldav.passwd -C -u kristaps
New password: *********
Repeat new password: *********
.Ed
.Pp
The user may then set their password:
.Pp
.Dl % kcaldav.passwd -ne kristaps@bsd.lv
.Pp
Or add calendars:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
% kcaldav.passwd -nd newcalendar
% kcaldav.passwd -nd secondcalendar
.Ed
.Pp
To add resources to a new or existing calendar:
.Pp
.Dl % kcaldav.passwd -nd newcalendar file1.ics file2.ics
